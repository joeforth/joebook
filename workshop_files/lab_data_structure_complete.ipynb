    "Being able to carry out data processing and analysis in python and then adding the transformed data to a database management system (DBMS) can not only makes the data flows in research labs more effective, but also aligns with FAIR principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of effective data storage becomes increasingly important with the increasing integration of automation and to make the most of advances in data analysis and prediction.[[1](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sc/d2sc05142g), [2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-022-00910-7)]\n",

    "Computationally-generated data can its own issues, particularly in terms of volume. As discussed previously, experimentally-generated and measured data comes in many different forms, from varied sources and can vary greatly in terms of its structure; for example, instrument readings, reaction conditions, experimental outcomes, and metadata about samples\n",

    "Managing the processing and storage of data from a lab setting is complex, even for relatively simple experimental workflows. Keeping the data structured, persistent, and easily accessible is crucial for reproducibility, analysis, and automation.

    "Relational database management systems (RDBMS) offer one approach to structuring data storage: They store data in tables, where relationships between data points are explicitly defined. Unlike spreadsheets, which can contain duplicated or inconsistent information, relational databases enforce data integrity and reduce redundancy through **normalisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence** Data is stored safely and remains available even after the program or system shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure and integrity** Data is organised into tables with clearly defined relationships, reducing errors and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability and Efficiency** Efficient querying through SQL (Structured Query Language) allows rapid retrieval and filtering of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessibility** Multiple users and systems can access and manipulate the data concurrently without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a structured storage system like a relational database (db) enables a transition from unstructured data (e.g. scattered experimental records in spreadsheets) to a system where data is systematically stored, so that it remains accessible and useful for downstream automation and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",

    "#### **Part 1** SQL + Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample of data from a set of lab experiments is available in the `data` directory as a flat file: `cox_experiments.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the SQLAlchemy package to connect to a SQLite database\n",
    "- Read a sample of data from an experimental lab study into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "- Process the data in pandas\n",
    "- Load the data into the SQLite database to store in a structured, persistent format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Part 2** Database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of using a relational database system is that it imposes some degree of structure on the data. This can help with ensuring the data is complete and avoids redundancy. Simply storing available data in a single table is not the most effective way to achieve those goals. Designing the structure of the database using concepts such as data normalisation can help to avoid inconsistencies in the data and overly complex relationships between tables, for example.\n",

    "### Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Structured Query Language](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/structured-query-language) (SQL) is a language used to query and manipulate databases. In CHEM501, you used a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database to store data in a structured form. You were able to connect to the database using python and execute queries in raw SQL, and this included adding data from a pandas `DataFrame` to a table in an SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to connect Python with a database such as a SQL db, offers the advantages of being able carry out data processing, analysis and modelling using the wide range of Python libraries, standardising data processes before storing the processed and analysed data in a persistent, structured format that is accessible to multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automation and integration with data sources and workflows\n",
    "   - Python can enable integration with lab instruments, data pipelines, and machine learning models.\n",
    "   - This can faciliate automated data entry, validation, and retrieval without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data processing and analysis \n",
    "   - Python provides a wide variety of libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.) for analysing and visualising stored data.\n",
    "   - Data can be accessed directly from the database, processed, and piped into further optimisation or scientific models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reproducibility & Consistency\n",
    "   - Developing Python scripts for data processing can ensure that it is standardised and reproducible across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQLalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) is a package that lets you interact with a SQL database using python. It provides an abstraction layer over the raw SQL: It distances you from SQL, so you do not need to write raw SQL. This can make database interactions easier and more 'Pythonic'. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that it is more straightforward to change the underlying SQL database (e.g. from SQLite to mySQL or PostgreSQL) if you decide to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy manages connections to the database, so you do not need to worry about closing connections. The abstraction away from raw SQL queries means data validation can be built in and can prevent security issues like SQL injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an [SQLalchemy with sqlite tutorial ](https://builtin.com/data-science/python-sqlalchemy) that will help as you work through the notebook. The main points you will see in this notebook focus on getting started quickly using familiar data structures in Python, by showing how straightforward working with pandas dataframes and a sql database can be."

    "When designing a relational database, a key goal is **eliminating redundancy** and ensuring **data integrity**. This process is called **normalisation**. It involves organising data into multiple related tables instead of storing everything in a single, unstructured table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why normalise data?  \n",
    "**Reduces redundancy**: Avoids storing the same information multiple times (e.g., CAS numbers for chemicals).  \n",
    "**Improves consistency**: Changes in one place update automatically across the database.  \n",
    "**Enhances scalability**: Structured data is easier to query, update, and expand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The experiment data example\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental data you looked at in the earlier part has several issues in the way it is currently structured. \n",
    "It **repeats** chemical names and CAS numbers** for coformers, and **stores file paths as plain text**, which can make querying difficult. A normalised database would separate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiments** - linked to unique chemicals, solvents, and  characterisation data.  \n",
    "2. **Chemicals** - each chemical has a unique CAS number, reducing repetition.  \n",
    "3. **Characterisation Data** - storing file paths separately allows easy retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For you to consider\n",
    "- What issues might arise if the same chemical has multiple CAS numbers in different rows?  \n",
    "- How could we store characterisation data (NMR, PXRD) in a structured way instead of file paths in a single table?  \n",
    "- How can we design a system where updating or correcting a chemical's CAS number does not require changing existing experiment records?\n",
    "- What other information could be included in the database that would make the current data more complete or useful?\n",

    "- In your project, what are the sources of the data you will be working with?\n",
    "- How will they be processed before you store them?\n",
    "- How will they be stored? As flat files distributed across locations/servers or consolidated somehow?\n",
    "- How will you deal with metadata and connecting data from different sources, experiments, calculations?\n",
    "- If you were designing a data management system, where would you start? What kind of structure would be appropriate?\n",
    "- How could this improve the quality of the data (e.g. reduce errors, redundancy) or improve accessibility in the context of your project and/or research group?"
