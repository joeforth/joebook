    "Experimental characterisation methods like NMR and IR commonly produce datasets in the form of 1-dimensional (or sometimes 2D) spectra. For simple 1D NMR experiments, for example, the spectrum is usually output in the form of intensity vs. chemical shift $\\delta$ in ppm.\n",

    "Determining information about the structure of molecules in the sample usually starts with extracting information about the peaks present in the NMR spectrum. The peak information can then be interpreted to provide specific information about the composition and connectivity of the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, fitting peaks with a function that models the shape serves several purposes including: to gain some fundamental understanding of the nature of the data (e.g. does the method and/or specific instrument produce a particular peak shape); if the peaks are modelled well, the information on their centres, amplitudes can be more precise.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an overview how 1D spectral data can be analysed to acquire information about the peaks - positions of the centres, widths, intensities, etc. - we will look at a simple NMR spectrum and practise some pandas, matplotlib and scipy skills along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Processing spectra involves modelling data.* This exercise also gives us a chance to look more closely at how a model is being applied to the data and see some of the considerations and issues you should be aware of as you work with even simple data problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Real-World Data Modeling**: In many areas of chemistry (e.g., NMR, IR spectroscopy), fitting models to experimental data is crucial for extracting meaningful information, such as peak positions and intensities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Peak Fitting**: Fitting peaks with a model function helps extract more precise information about the data (e.g., determining peak centers, amplitudes, and widths) compared to raw data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of Least Squares**: Least squares optimisation plays a central role in fitting models to experimental data. It helps minimise the difference between the model predictions and the observed data, providing the best-fit parameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Considerations**: When fitting models, especially in noisy or complex data, it is important to consider the quality of the fit and how well the model reflects the underlying data. This exercise highlights common issues in fitting, such as choosing an appropriate model and evaluating the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Process**: Fitting is often an iterative process. You may need to try different initial guesses for the model parameters, refine the model, and evaluate how well the fit matches the data.\n",

    "- Write some code to add a line that shows the residuals as a difference plot below the final graph of the experimental and calculated data.\n",

Specialised NMR analysis libraries have methods to deal with more complex data much more efficiently (but many will still be using least squares underneath). Can you think of what additional complexities <sup>1</sup>H NMR might pose, for example? What issues might arise if peaks are much closer together?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The 7000 points of the NMR data have effectively been reduced to six numbers. This poses some questions about how data is stored, reported and used for further analysis. What factors might be important when making those decisions? Are there any disadvantages of only having the peak information available? Would the choice be different (how, why) in different scenarios?\n",
